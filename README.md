# Automated-Analysis-Project
  Worte a Python script that uses an LLM to analyze, visualize, and narrate a story from a dataset.
  The Python script accepts a single CSV filename like below
  ## uv run autolysis.py dataset.csv
  
  This creates, in your current directory, the following files:

  #A single Markdown file called README.md with results of your automated analysis, written as a story.
  #1-3 charts as PNG providing supporting data visualizations.
